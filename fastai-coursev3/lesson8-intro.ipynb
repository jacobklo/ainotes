You can see they're all variations of the same thing you know, and then you can customize rather than picking algorithm A or algorithm B. You create your own algorithm to solve your own problem doing just the things you need it to do, and then you can make sure that you know that it performs well; you can debug it, profile it, maintain it, because you understand all of the pieces. \n",
